# Coral-Image-Classification
Python-pytorch model for image classification
Machine Learning Coral Image Classification Model:
With the help of python and pytorch, I created an image classification model.
The Zip file includes all the code except the data.
Data was too big to be attached here.
Model Architecture:
I used a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this project.
Models: Resnet18,50
Trained Model From Scratch
Note: If you need the testing Data you can contact me.
Did this on jupyter notebook
